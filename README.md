## 1. Modular Components (The Lego Blocks)

### Overview

The foundation of the system lies in its modular components. These are the fundamental building blocks that can be combined in various ways to create diverse game mechanics.

### Atomic Actions

- **Definition**: Granular actions that dictate the behavior in a game.
- **Examples**:
  - **Move**: Change the position of an entity.
  - **Check**: Validate a condition or state.
  - **Update**: Modify the state or attributes of an entity.
  - **Initialize**: Set initial conditions or states.

### Atomic Conditions

- **Definition**: Basic conditions that guide the flow of the game.
- **Examples**:
  - **IsFull?**: Check if a specific container or space is full.
  - **IsAlive?**: Determine if an entity is active or inactive.
  - **IsConnected?**: Validate if entities are linked or related.

## 2. Dynamic Flow Construction

### Overview

The system allows for the dynamic construction of game flows using atomic actions and conditions.

### Flow Templates

- **Definition**: Basic structures that define the progression of a game.
- **Examples**:
  - **Start -> Play -> End**: A simple linear flow.
  - **Initialize -> Loop (Check -> Update) -> Conclude**: A repetitive flow with continuous checks and updates.

## 3. Rule Generators

### Overview

The system introduces dynamic rule generation, moving away from static rule sets.

### Parameterized Rules

- **Definition**: Rules that can be tweaked based on specific parameters.
- **Examples**:
  - **Alive Neighbors**: In Conway's Game of Life, the number of neighbors required for a cell to be alive can be parameterized.

## 4. Environment Templates

### Overview

Environments act as canvases where game mechanics are executed.

### Basic Templates

- **2D Grid**: A flat matrix where entities can move horizontally and vertically.
- **3D Grid**: A volumetric space with depth, allowing for multi-dimensional movement.
- **Graph**: A network of nodes and edges, representing interconnected entities.

## 5. Neural Network Playground

### Overview

Neural networks play, learn, and evolve within the system, enhancing its adaptability.

### Training Mode

- **Purpose**: Neural networks play existing games to understand mechanics and strategies.

### Evolution Mode

- **Purpose**: Neural networks modify or create new games based on learned knowledge.

### Feedback Loop

- **Definition**: A mechanism where game outcomes are fed back into the system for continuous evolution.

## 6. Game Repository

### Overview

A dynamic storage system for games, capturing their essence and evolution.

### Versioning

- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve different versions of games as they evolve.

### Metadata

- **Definition**: Data that describes the components, history, and feedback of each game.
