# System Ontology Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the ontology practices, definitions, and standards for the neural-network-playground system. Ontology, in this context, refers to the set of concepts, terms, and categories that will be used throughout the system, ensuring clarity and consistency.

## Ontology Practices

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that terms and definitions are used consistently across all documents and code.
2. **Clarity**: Definitions should be clear and unambiguous.
3. **Modularity**: Concepts should be broken down into their most fundamental forms.
4. **Evolution**: The ontology should be flexible enough to evolve as the system grows and changes.

## Core Definitions

### Modular Component

- **Definition**: The fundamental building blocks used to construct game mechanics.
- **Examples**: Atomic Actions, Atomic Conditions.

### Dynamic Flow

- **Definition**: The sequence or progression of game mechanics, constructed using modular components.
- **Examples**: Flow Templates.

### Rule Generator

- **Definition**: Functions or algorithms that generate game rules based on certain parameters or feedback.
- **Examples**: Parameterized Rules.

### Environment Template

- **Definition**: Basic structures where game mechanics are executed.
- **Examples**: 2D Grid, 3D Grid, Graph.

### Neural Network Playground

- **Definition**: The space where neural networks interact with the system to play, learn, and evolve game mechanics.
- **Examples**: Training Mode, Evolution Mode.

### Game Repository

- **Definition**: A storage system for games, capturing their essence and evolution.
- **Examples**: Versioning, Metadata.

## Naming Conventions

1. **CamelCase**: Use CamelCase for multi-word terms, e.g., `AtomicAction`.
2. **Plural Forms**: Use plural forms for categories or sets, e.g., `FlowTemplates`.
3. **Descriptive Names**: Names should be descriptive and reflect the essence of the concept, e.g., `NeuralNetworkPlayground`.

## Conclusion

A well-defined ontology ensures that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of the system's components and their interactions. It provides a solid foundation for development, documentation, and future evolution.


# Scenario: Designing a Dynamic Game Evolution System

### Background:

Imagine a system called "EvoGame" that allows users to create simple 2D games. The initial design of EvoGame was straightforward: users could create games using a drag-and-drop interface, defining game objects, their behaviors, and the rules of the game.

However, as the user base grew, so did the complexity and diversity of the games. Users wanted to introduce more advanced mechanics, AI players, and even evolve existing games based on player feedback.

To accommodate these needs, the EvoGame team decided to revamp the system, applying advanced ontological expertise.

### Application of Advanced Ontology:

1. **Entities & Attributes**:
   - The team defined clear entities like `GameObject`, `Player`, `Rule`, and `AIModel`.
   - Each entity had well-defined attributes. For instance, `GameObject` had attributes like `Position`, `Behavior`, and `InteractionType`.

2. **Relationships & Cardinality**:
   - The relationship between `Game` and `GameObject` was defined as one-to-many, meaning a game could have multiple objects, but each object belonged to one game.
   - An AI model could be associated with multiple games, introducing a many-to-many relationship between `Game` and `AIModel`.

3. **Inheritance & Polymorphism**:
   - Game objects were designed to inherit from a base `GameObject` class. This allowed for the easy introduction of new object types like `MovingObject`, `StaticObject`, or `InteractiveObject`.
   - Polymorphism ensured that each object type could have unique behaviors while still being treated as a generic `GameObject` in the system.

4. **Aggregation & Composition**:
   - `Game` and `Rule` had a composition relationship. If a game was deleted, its associated rules were also removed.
   - `Game` and `AIModel` had an aggregation relationship, meaning an AI model could exist independently of a game.

5. **Constraints & Validations**:
   - The system ensured that game objects' positions were always within the game's boundaries.
   - AI models had constraints on their size and complexity to ensure efficient performance.

### Outcome:

With the application of advanced ontology:

- **Modularity**: The system became highly modular. New game mechanics, objects, or AI models could be introduced without disrupting existing functionalities.
  
- **Self-Documentation**: The clear ontology served as self-documentation. New developers could understand the system's structure and relationships quickly.
  
- **Automation**: The system could automatically validate games, ensuring they adhered to the defined ontology. This reduced errors and improved game quality.
  
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Users could now evolve games, introduce AI players, and even allow AI to modify game rules or mechanics, all while ensuring the system's integrity.

### Conclusion:

The application of advanced and complex ontological expertise transformed EvoGame from a simple game creation tool to a dynamic, evolving platform. The clear ontology ensured modularity, automation, and adaptability, catering to the diverse and growing needs of its user base.
